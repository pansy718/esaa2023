the first word.\", '\"While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible\\nfor her.', 'She could never quit him.\"', 'Part only of this answer,\\nhowever, was admitted.', 'The impossibility of her quitting her father,\\nMr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility\\nof any other change, he could not agree to.', \"He had been thinking\\nit over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce\\nMr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe\\nit feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer\\nhim to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion,\\nthat such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort,\\nperhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded.\", 'Mr. Woodhouse\\ntaken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted.', \"But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted\\nhis dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;\\nit was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as\\nher father's happiness in other words his life--required Hartfield\\nto continue her home, it should be his likewise.\", 'Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own\\npassing thoughts.', 'Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it;\\nbut such an alternative as this had not occurred to her.', 'She was sensible of all the affection it evinced.', 'She felt that,\\nin quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence\\nof hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father,\\nand in no house of his own, there would be much, very much,\\nto be borne with.', 'She promised to think of it, and advised him\\nto think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection\\ncould alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject.', 'He had\\ngiven it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration;\\nhe had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning,\\nto have his thoughts to himself.', '\"Ah!', 'there is one difficulty unprovided for,\" cried Emma.', '\"I am\\nsure William Larkins will not like it.', 'You must get his consent\\nbefore you ask mine.\"', 'She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover,\\nto think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.', 'It is

rights\\nas heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded.', \"Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy;\\nand yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it,\\nand found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent\\ndislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else,\\nwhich at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of\\nthe sister and the aunt.\", 'This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--\\nthe more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.', 'His evils

partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be\\ngiving increase of melancholy!', 'She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every\\nblessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings\\nof her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.', 'The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself,\\npoor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a\\ndistance from.', 'She would be a loser in every way.', 'Emma could not\\ndeplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment.', 'In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise;\\nbut for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity\\nthat was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.', 'In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\\nsupplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.', 'Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--\\nnot like Mr. Elton.', 'Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling,\\nso truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be\\nless worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even\\nof Harriet, that she could be in love with more than _three_ men\\nin one year.', 'CHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nIt was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous\\nas herself to avoid a meeting.', 'Their intercourse was painful\\nenough by letter.', 'How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!', 'Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,\\nwithout reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied\\nthere was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in\\nher style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--\\nIt might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an\\nangel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.', \"She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation;\\nand she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,\\nwithout resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.\", 'Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.', \"Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill\\nhealth was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a\\ndentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet\\nunder her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister's side,\\nEmma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.--\\nHarriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was\\nto be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged,\\nit was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.\", \"Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she\\ncould talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by\\nthat sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful,\\nwhich had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was\\nnear her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance,\\nbe enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.\", \"The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps\\nan unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not\\nthink of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,\\nwhich must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\", 'She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\\nin her mind which Harriet had occupied.', 'There was a communication\\nbefore her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--\\nthe confession of her engagement to her father; but she would\\nhave nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer\\nthe disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.', 'No additional\\nagitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved--\\nand the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the\\nappointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,\\nto crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.', 'She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half\\nan hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--\\nShe ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of\\ntheir present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill.', 'It would be a _secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a\\nsimilarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with\\nwhich she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.', 'She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had\\nnot been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor\\nJane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,\\nthough all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--\\nThe fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured\\nof their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--\\nShe heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor\\nMiss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard\\nnothing but the instant reply of, \"Beg her to walk up;\"--and a moment\\nafterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly\\nforward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.--\\nEmma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.', 'There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every\\nthing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--\\nShe came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very\\nfeeling tone,\\n\\n\"This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible\\nfor me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being\\nso entirely without words.\"', \"Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,\\nif the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not\\nchecked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly\\nand all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest\\nshake of the hand.\", 'Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together.', 'Miss Bates was out,\\nwhich accounted for the previous tranquillity.', 'Emma could have\\nwished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience\\nwith every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness,\\nshe hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.', \"She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts,\\nand understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits;\\nit was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself\\nacquainted with what was still a secret to other people.\", 'Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face;\\nand while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing\\nto attend to the good old lady\\'s replies, she saw her with a sort\\nof anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently\\nbeen reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple\\nand gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,\\n\\n\"We can finish this some other time, you know.', 'You and I shall\\nnot want opportunities.', 'And, in fact, you have heard all the\\nessential already.', 'I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits\\nour apology, and

observe.--Oh!', 'no; cautious as\\na minister of state.', 'I managed it extremely well.\"', 'Emma could not doubt.', 'It was a palpable display, repeated on every\\npossible occasion.', 'When they had all talked a little while in harmony\\nof the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,\\n\\n\"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\\ncharmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the\\nhighest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)', 'Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--\\nOh!', 'if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!\"', '--\\nAnd when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther,\\n\"We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might

afterwards began, \"since the party to Box Hill.', 'Very pleasant party.', 'But yet I think there was something wanting.', 'Things did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon\\nthe spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might\\nbe mistaken.', 'However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one\\nto go again.', 'What say you both to our collecting the same party,\\nand exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?--\\nIt must be the same party, you know, quite the same party,\\nnot _one_ exception.\"', 'Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted\\nby the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,\\nfrom doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.', '\"Thank you, dear Miss

said,\\n\\n\"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long,\\nthat anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise;\\nbut, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and

Jane was wanting to give her words,\\nnot to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.', 'The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted,\\nwas very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.', 'Mr. Elton made his appearance.', 'His lady greeted him with some\\nof her sparkling vivacity.', '\"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\\nencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--\\nBut you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with.', 'You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.--\\nHere have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies\\na sample of true conjugal obedience--for who can say, you know,\\nhow soon it may be wanted?\"', 'Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.', 'His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\\nobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering,\\nand the walk he

'But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.\"', '\"He writes like a sensible man,\" replied Emma, when she had read\\nthe letter.', '\"I honour his sincerity.', 'It is very plain that he\\nconsiders the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side,\\nbut that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy\\nof your affection, as you think me already.', 'Had he said any thing\\nto bear a different construction, I should not have believed him.\"', '\"My Emma, he means no such thing.', 'He only means--\"\\n\\n\"He and I should differ very little in our estimation

Emma--\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\"', 'she cried with more thorough gaiety, \"if you fancy your\\nbrother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in\\nthe secret, and hear his opinion.', 'Depend upon it, he will be much\\nfarther from doing _you_ justice.', 'He will think all the happiness,\\nall the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit\\non mine.', 'I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma\\' with him at once.--\\nHis tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther.\"', '\"Ah!\"', 'he cried, \"I wish your father might be half as easily convinced\\nas John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,\\nto be happy together.', 'I am amused by one part of John\\'s letter--\\ndid you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take\\nhim wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing\\nsomething of the kind.\"', '\"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having\\nsome thoughts of marrying.', 'He had no idea of me.', 'He seems perfectly\\nunprepared for that.\"', '\"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into\\nmy feelings.', 'What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious\\nof any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare\\nhim at this time for my marrying any more than at another.--\\nBut it was so, I suppose.', 'I dare say there was a difference when I\\nwas staying with them the other day.', 'I believe I did not play\\nwith the children quite so much as usual.', 'I remember one evening\\nthe poor boys saying, `Uncle seems always tired now.\\'\"', \"The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons'\\nreception of it tried.\", \"As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\\nrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view\\nthat her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause,\\nresolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--\\nBut how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself\\nto do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it\\ncame to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must\\nhave put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time,\\nand follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced\\nto speak, and to speak cheerfully too.\", 'She must not make it a more\\ndecided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.', \"She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits\\nshe could command, she prepared him first for something strange,\\nand then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation\\ncould be obtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with\\nno difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--\\nshe and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield\\nwould receive the constant addition of that person's company\\nwhom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston,\\nbest in the world.\", 'Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\\nearnestly to dissuade her from it.', 'She was reminded, more than once,\\nof having always said she would never marry, and assured that it\\nwould be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of\\npoor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do.', 'Emma hung\\nabout him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that\\nhe must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages\\ntaking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change:\\nbut she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there;\\nshe was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but\\nfor the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal\\nthe happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once\\ngot used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?--\\nHe would not deny that he did, she was sure.--Whom did he ever want\\nto consult on business but Mr.', 'Knightley?--Who was so useful to him,\\nwho so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?--\\nWho so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?--Would not he\\nlike to have him always on the spot?--Yes.', 'That was all very true.', 'Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see\\nhim every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could\\nnot they go on as they had done?', \"Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\\nthe idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--\\nTo Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's,\\nwhose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome;\\nand he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--\\nThey had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters\\nof the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready,\\non the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most\\nserviceable light--first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one--\\nwell aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations\\nto Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed upon, as what was to be;\\nand every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that\\nit would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself\\nwhich almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other--\\nin another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very bad\\nif the marriage did take place.\", 'Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\\nsaid to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,\\nnever more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her;\\nbut she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had\\nno scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard\\nfor Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma;\\nand it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable\\na connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance,\\nso peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed\\nas if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature,\\nand that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having\\nthought of it, and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men\\nin a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own\\nhome for Hartfield!', \"And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear\\nwith Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--\\nThe difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always\\nfelt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank\\nand Emma.\", 'How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had\\nbeen a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than\\nby herself--but even he had never been able to finish the subject\\nbetter than by saying--\"Those matters will take care of themselves;\\nthe young people will find a way.\"', 'But here there was nothing to be\\nshifted off in a wild speculation on the future.', 'It was all right,\\nall open, all equal.', 'No sacrifice on any side worth the name.', 'It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself,\\nand without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.', 'Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\\nas these, was one of the happiest women in the world.', 'If any thing\\ncould increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would\\nsoon have outgrown its first set of caps.', 'The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread;\\nand Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes\\nwere enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--\\nHe saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all\\nthe constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing;\\nand by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he\\nhad always foreseen it.', '\"It is to be a secret, I conclude,\" said he.', '\"These matters are\\nalways a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them.', 'Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has\\nany suspicion.\"', 'He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on\\nthat point.', 'He told her the news.', 'Was not she like a daughter,\\nhis eldest daughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present,\\nit passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton,\\nimmediately afterwards.', 'It was no more than the principals were\\nprepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known\\nat Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking\\nof themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle,\\nwith great sagacity.', 'In general, it was a very well approved match.', 'Some might think him,\\nand others might think her, the most in luck.', 'One set might\\nrecommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield\\nfor the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements\\namong their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious\\nobjection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There,\\nthe surprize was not softened by any satisfaction.', 'Mr. Elton\\ncared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped \"the\\nyoung lady\\'s pride would now be contented;\" and supposed \"she had\\nalways meant to catch Knightley if she could;\" and, on the point\\nof living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, \"Rather he than I!\"', '--\\nBut Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--\"Poor Knightley!', 'poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned;\\nfor, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.--\\nHow could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love--\\nnot in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all\\npleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine\\nwith them whenever they asked him!', 'But that would be all over now.--\\nPoor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_.', 'Oh!', 'no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on\\nevery thing.--Extremely disagreeable!', 'But she was not at all sorry\\nthat she had abused the housekeeper the other

XVIII\\n\\n\\nTime passed on.', 'A few more to-morrows, and the party from London\\nwould be arriving.', 'It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking\\nof it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and\\ngrieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts\\nwere put by.', 'After the first chat of pleasure he was silent;\\nand then, in a graver tone, began with,\\n\\n\"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.\"', '\"Good or bad?\"', 'said she, quickly, looking up in his face.', '\"I do not know which it ought to be called.\"', '\"Oh!', 'good I am

one, on which\\nwe do not think alike.\"', 'He paused a moment, again smiling,\\nwith his eyes fixed on her face.', '\"Does nothing occur to you?--\\nDo not you recollect?--Harriet Smith.\"', 'Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,\\nthough she knew not what.', '\"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?\"', 'cried he.', '\"You have, I believe, and know the whole.\"', '\"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.\"', '\"You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is.', 'Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin.\"', 'Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--\\nand her eyes, in eager gaze, said, \"No, this is impossible!\"', 'but her lips were closed.', '\"It is so, indeed,\" continued Mr. Knightley; \"I have it from Robert\\nMartin himself.', 'He left me not half an hour ago.\"', 'She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.', '\"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions

done it,\" answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling\\nbut determined decision, \"and been accepted.\"', '\"Good God!\"', 'she cried.--\"Well!\"', '--Then having recourse to her workbasket,\\nin excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the\\nexquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she\\nmust be expressing, she added, \"Well, now tell me every thing;\\nmake this intelligible to me.', 'How, where, when?--Let me know it all.', 'I never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy,\\nI assure you.--How--how has it been possible?\"', '\"It is a very simple

interesting.--In our communications we deal only\\nin the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin\\'s heart seemed\\nfor _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did mention,\\nwithout its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their\\nbox at Astley\\'s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley\\nand little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\\nand that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\\nrather uneasy.\"', 'He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.', 'To speak,\\nshe was sure would be to

concerned, you could not wish your\\nfriend in better hands.', 'His rank in society I would alter if I could,\\nwhich is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me\\nabout William

believe her very lately more\\ndetermined against him, much more, than she was before.\"', '\"You ought to know your friend best,\" replied Mr. Knightley;\\n\"but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl,\\nnot likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told\\nher he loved her.\"', 'Emma could not help laughing as she answered, \"Upon my word,\\nI believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley,\\nare you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright\\n_accepted_ him.', 'I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--\\nDid not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things;\\nof business, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you,\\nin the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not\\nHarriet\\'s hand that he was certain of--it was the dimensions of some\\nfamous ox.\"', 'The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and\\nRobert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma\\'s feelings,\\nand so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently\\npassed on Harriet\\'s side, so fresh the sound of those words,\\nspoken with such emphasis, \"No, I hope I know better than to think\\nof Robert Martin,\" that she was really expecting the intelligence\\nto prove, in some measure, premature.', 'It could not be otherwise.', '\"Do you dare say this?\"', 'cried Mr. Knightley.', '\"Do you dare to suppose\\nme so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--\\nWhat do you deserve?\"', '\"Oh!', 'I always deserve the best treatment,

'\"I am quite sure,\" he replied, speaking very distinctly, \"that he\\ntold me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity,\\nnothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you\\na proof that it must be so.', 'He asked my opinion as to what he\\nwas now to do.', 'He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he\\ncould apply for information of her relations or friends.', 'Could I\\nmention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard?', 'I assured him that I could not.', 'Then, he said, he would endeavour\\nto see her in the course of this day.\"', '\"I

so--for at that time I was a fool.\"', '\"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\\nHarriet\\'s good qualities.', \"I have taken some pains for your sake,\\nand for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe\\nas much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her.\", 'I have often talked to her a good deal.', 'You must have seen that\\nI did.', 'Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me\\nof pleading poor Martin\\'s cause, which was never the case; but, from all\\nmy observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,\\nwith very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing\\nher happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.--\\nMuch of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for.\"', '\"Me!\"', 'cried Emma, shaking her head.--\"Ah!', 'poor Harriet!\"', 'She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little\\nmore praise than she deserved.', 'Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of\\nher father.', 'She was not sorry.', 'She wanted to be alone.', 'Her mind\\nwas in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her\\nto be collected.', 'She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits;\\nand till she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed\\nand reflected, she could be fit for nothing

really in danger of becoming\\ntoo happy for security.--What had she to wish for?\", 'Nothing, but to\\ngrow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been\\never so superior to her own.', 'Nothing, but that the lessons\\nof her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.', 'Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions;\\nand yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst\\nof them.', 'She must laugh at such a close!', 'Such an end of the doleful\\ndisappointment of five weeks back!', 'Such a heart--such a Harriet!', 'Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would\\nbe a pleasure.', 'It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.', 'High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities,\\nwas the reflection that all necessity of concealment from\\nMr. Knightley would soon be over.', 'The disguise, equivocation,\\nmystery, so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over.', 'She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect\\nconfidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.', 'In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;\\nnot always listening, but always agreeing to what he said;\\nand, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable\\npersuasion of his being obliged to go to

Weston.', '\"I was just\\ngoing to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive\\nthis morning.', 'He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been\\npersuaded to spend the day with

each side.', 'They met readily and smiling,\\nbut with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said;\\nand having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank\\nin the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged,\\nwhich she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more,\\nand of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure.', 'When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby\\nwas fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--\\nor of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her\\nand

retract what you\\nthen said.\"', '\"No, indeed,\" cried Emma, most happy to begin, \"not in the least.', 'I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give\\nyou joy in person.\"', 'He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak\\nwith serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.', '\"Is not she looking well?\"', 'said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.', '\"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and\\nMrs. Weston doat upon her.\"', 'But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,\\nafter mentioning the expected return

shame,\" he answered, \"is all mine, or ought to be.', 'But is it\\npossible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.', 'Early, I know,\\nyou had none.\"', '\"I never had the smallest, I assure

recollection, that Emma could\\nnot help saying,\\n\\n\"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,\\nyou had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--\\nI am sure it was a consolation to you.\"', '\"Oh!', 'no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing?', 'I was the most miserable wretch!\"', '\"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.',

her vain attempt to frown.', 'Look at her.', 'Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage\\nof her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--\\nthat the whole blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to\\nnothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?\"', 'Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile\\npartly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,\\nlow, yet steady voice,\\n\\n\"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--\\nThey _will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!\"', \"He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly;\\nbut Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on\\nleaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men,\\nshe felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill,\\nand really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never\\nbeen more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character.\", 'The happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the\\nanimated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.', 'CHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet,\\na momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured\\nof her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept\\nanother man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she\\nhad to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty.', 'A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no\\nsooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet,\\nthan she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable as it was!--\\nthat Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\\nand was now forming all her views of happiness.', \"Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\\nbut having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,\\nand self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die\\naway with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,\\nand with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to\\nher friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of\\nthat nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--\\nHarriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at\\nAstley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all\\nwith the utmost delight.\", 'But what did such particulars explain?--\\nThe fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had\\nalways liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had\\nbeen irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible\\nto Emma.', \"The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her\\nfresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known.\", 'She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford\\nher the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent\\nenough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood\\nof gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--\\nIt was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many\\na gentleman:  but what a connexion had she been preparing for\\nMr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr.', 'Elton!--\\nThe stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth,\\nwould have been a stain indeed.', \"No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was\\ntreated liberally; it was all as it should be:  and as Emma became\\nacquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,\\nshe fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth\\nwhich could bid fairest for her little friend.\", \"She had no doubt\\nof Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him,\\nand in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more,\\nof security, stability, and improvement.\", 'She would be placed in the\\nmidst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself;\\nretired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.', 'She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out.', 'She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be\\nthe luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and\\npersevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest,\\nto yield only to herself.', 'Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\\nwas less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--\\nThe intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must\\nchange into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought\\nto be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual,\\nnatural manner.', 'Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\\nher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction,\\nas no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood\\nbefore them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she\\nscarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the\\naltar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith,\\nthe latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.', 'Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\\ncomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills\\nwere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.', 'The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared,\\nby Emma and Mr.', \"Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage\\nought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,\\nto allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside,\\nwhich was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend,\\nwere agreed in approving it.\", 'But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse\\nto be induced to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their\\nmarriage but as a distant event.', 'When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they\\nwere almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--\\nHe began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--\\na very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.', 'Still, however, he was not happy.', \"Nay, he appeared so much otherwise,\\nthat his daughter's courage failed.\", 'She could not bear to see\\nhim suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though\\nher understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the\\nMr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress\\nwould be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed.', \"In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\\nillumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his\\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.--\\nMrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys--\\nevidently by the ingenuity of man.\", \"Other poultry-yards in the\\nneighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to\\nMr. Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense\\nof his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm\\nevery night of his life.\", 'The strength, resolution, and presence\\nof mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.', 'While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--\\nBut Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the\\nfirst week in November.', 'The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at\\nthe moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was\\ncalled on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert\\nMartin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.', 'The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties\\nhave no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the\\nparticulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,\\nand very inferior to her own.--\"Very little white satin, very few\\nlace veils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she\\nheard of it.\"', '--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes,\\nthe hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band\\nof true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered\\nin the perfect happiness of the union.',
